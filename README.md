Here is a webpage that shows various visualizations of operations on a rubics cube. 

Interesting Questions:

What is the simplest set of operations that traverses all solutions of the rubics cube? 
    - I feel like certain operations just make an infinite loop that traverses only a subset of the solutions
Given a solved cube, how many operations would i take to eventually come back to the original solution?
What is the furthest away you can be from the solution?>

Observations
    - The center tile of each face has an opposite color that remains fixed.
        - White is opposite Yellow, Red opposite Orange and Green is opposite Blue
